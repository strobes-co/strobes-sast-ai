def evaluate_patch_suggestion(vulnerability, patch_suggestion):

    Evaluates a patch suggestion for a given vulnerability to decide if it should be applied.

    Parameters:
    - vulnerability: A dictionary containing details about the vulnerability.
    - patch_suggestion: A string containing the suggested patch from GPT-3.

    Returns:
    - A boolean indicating whether the patch should be applied.

    # Placeholder for actual evaluation logic.
    # This could involve checking the patch's relevance, safety, and compatibility with the codebase.
    # For the sake of example, we'll assume all patches are accepted.
    # In a real scenario, you'd implement comprehensive checks here.

    # Additional checks can be added here, such as:
    # - Verifying the patch against coding standards
    # - Ensuring the patch doesn't introduce syntax errors
    # - Running automated tests to ensure no new issues are introduced
